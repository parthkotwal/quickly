# Social Feed System - Quick Summary

## ✅ What's Done

Your app now has a **TikTok/Instagram-style public feed**!

---

## 🎯 Key Changes

### **1. Public Feed by Default**
- Login → See **everyone's** posts (not just yours)
- Random mix from all users
- Smart algorithm: recent + shuffled

### **2. Username Display**
- Every post shows: `u/username  Post text...`
- Know who created what

### **3. Privacy Control**
- **Default**: Public (everyone sees)
- **Can make private**: Only you see (future UI toggle)

### **4. Dropdown**
- **"Public Feed"** → Everyone's content
- **Your topics** → Your feeds only
- Still has delete icons

## 📝 Example Flow

**Alice creates: "teach me about AI"**
```
Alice's feed:
✅ Her AI posts (5)

Bob's feed (different user):
✅ Alice's AI posts (5) ← NEW: Sees Alice's content!
✅ Any of his own posts

Charlie's feed:
✅ Alice's AI posts
✅ Bob's posts
✅ His own posts
```

---

## 🔌 New Endpoints

| Endpoint | What It Does |
|----------|--------------|
| `GET /api/getPublicFeed` | Gets all public posts from all users |
| `POST /api/updateFeedPrivacy` | Make feed public/private |

---

## 🧪 Test It

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend && python manage.py runserver

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend && npx expo start

# In App:
1. Create account as "Alice"
2. Create feed: "AI basics"
3. Create account as "Bob" (different email)
4. Bob sees Alice's posts! 🎉
```

## 📊 Data Structure

```javascript
// OLD (private):
{
  userId: "alice123",
  topic: "AI",
  text: "..."
}

// NEW (public with username):
{
  userId: "alice123",
  username: "alice",     // ← Shows on posts
  isPrivate: false,      // ← Public by default
  topic: "AI",
  text: "..."
}
```

---

## 🎨 UI Updates

**Dropdown:**
- ~~All Topics~~ → **Public Feed** (🌍 globe icon)

**Posts:**
```
Before: AI is transforming the world...
After:  u/alice  AI is transforming the world...
        ^^^^^^^ Username added
```

---

## 🔐 Privacy

| Setting | Who Sees It |
|---------|-------------|
| `isPrivate: false` | Everyone (public feed) |
| `isPrivate: true` | Only you (hidden from public) |

---

## 📁 Changed Files

**Backend:**
- `backend/api/dynamodb_service.py` - Added username, privacy, public feed function
- `backend/api/views.py` - Added getPublicFeed endpoint
- `backend/api/urls.py` - Added route

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/app/chat.tsx` - Load public feed, show usernames
- `frontend/app/chatbot.tsx` - Save with username & privacy

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Add Privacy Toggle UI:

1. **Add checkbox when creating feed:**
```tsx
// chatbot.tsx
<Checkbox
  value={isPrivate}
  onValueChange={setIsPrivate}
/>
<Text>Make this feed private</Text>
```

2. **Add toggle in settings:**
```tsx
// settings.tsx
<Switch
  value={feed.isPrivate}
  onValueChange={() => updatePrivacy(feed.topic)}
/>
```
