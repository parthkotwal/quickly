# Soft Delete System - How It Works

## 🎯 The Problem You Identified

**Before:**
```
Alice creates: "teach me about AI"
  ↓
Bob sees Alice's AI posts in his public feed
  ↓
Alice clicks delete 🗑️
  ↓
Posts deleted from DynamoDB
  ↓
Bob's feed: Posts disappear! ❌
```

**Issue:** When a user deletes their feed, it disappears from everyone's view. This breaks the social feed experience.

## ✅ The Solution: Soft Delete

**Now:**
```
Alice creates: "teach me about AI"
  ↓
Bob sees Alice's AI posts in his public feed
  ↓
Alice clicks delete 🗑️
  ↓
Posts marked as deletedByCreator = true (still in DB)
  ↓
Alice's dropdown: Topic removed ✅
Bob's feed: Posts still visible! ✅
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Data Structure:**

```javascript
// Before Alice deletes:
{
  userId: "alice123",
  postId: "ai_123_0",
  topic: "teach me about AI",
  username: "alice",
  isPrivate: false,
  deletedByCreator: false  // or field doesn't exist
  ...
}

// After Alice "deletes":
{
  userId: "alice123",
  postId: "ai_123_0",
  topic: "teach me about AI",
  username: "alice",
  isPrivate: false,
  deletedByCreator: true,  // ← Marked as deleted, not removed from DB
  ...
}
```

---

## 📊 Filter Logic

### **Public Feed (Everyone):**
```python
# Shows posts that are:
# 1. Public (isPrivate = false)
# 2. NOT deleted by creator (deletedByCreator = false or doesn't exist)

FilterExpression='(isPrivate = false) AND (deletedByCreator = false OR attribute_not_exists(deletedByCreator))'
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Bob still sees Alice's posts
- ❌ New users WON'T see Alice's deleted posts

### **Alice's Topics Dropdown:**
```python
# Only shows topics where posts are NOT deleted

active_posts = [p for p in posts if not p.get('deletedByCreator', False)]
topics = extract_topics(active_posts)
```

**Result:**
- ❌ Alice doesn't see "teach me about AI" in her dropdown anymore
- ✅ Topic successfully "deleted" from her view

### **Alice's Feed View (if she clicks a topic):**
```python
# Only shows posts NOT marked as deleted

FilterExpression='topic = :topic AND (deletedByCreator = false OR attribute_not_exists(deletedByCreator))'
```

**Result:**
- ❌ Alice can't access those posts anymore
- ✅ Behaves like they're deleted for her

## 🎭 The Illusion

From **Alice's perspective:**
- Posts are deleted ✅
- Topic removed from dropdown ✅
- Can't see those posts anywhere ✅

From **Bob's perspective:**
- Posts still visible in public feed ✅
- Can like, view, comment ✅
- No indication they were "deleted" ✅

From **Database perspective:**
- Posts still exist in DynamoDB ✅
- Just marked with `deletedByCreator: true` ✅
- Can be "restored" if needed ✅

## 🔄 Complete Flow Example

### Scenario: Alice deletes a feed

**1. Alice's view BEFORE delete:**
```
Dropdown:
  🌍 Public Feed
  📚 AI basics 🗑️
  📚 quantum physics 🗑️

Public Feed:
  u/alice  AI is amazing...
  u/bob    Quantum states...
```

**2. Alice clicks 🗑️ on "AI basics"**
```javascript
// Backend runs:
UPDATE quickly-posts
SET deletedByCreator = true
WHERE userId = 'alice123' AND topic = 'AI basics'
```

**3. Alice's view AFTER delete:**
```
Dropdown:
  🌍 Public Feed
  📚 quantum physics 🗑️
  (AI basics is GONE)

Public Feed:
  u/bob    Quantum states...
  u/charlie Chemistry is...
  (Alice's AI posts still show in public, but she doesn't see them as "hers")
```

**4. Bob's view (unchanged):**
```
Dropdown:
  🌍 Public Feed
  📚 his topic 1
  📚 his topic 2

Public Feed:
  u/alice  AI is amazing...  ← STILL HERE!
  u/bob    Quantum states...
  u/charlie Chemistry is...
```

## 🤔 Why Not Hard Delete?

### **Hard Delete (what you had before):**
```python
def delete_feed(user_id, topic):
    posts = get_posts_by_topic(user_id, topic)
    for post in posts:
        table.delete_item(Key={'userId': user_id, 'postId': post['postId']})
    # Posts gone from DB permanently!
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Posts disappear from everyone's feed
- ❌ Breaks the social feed experience
- ❌ Users lose content they were viewing
- ❌ Can't undo delete
- ❌ Analytics lost

### **Soft Delete (what you have now):**
```python
def delete_feed(user_id, topic):
    posts = get_posts_by_topic(user_id, topic)
    for post in posts:
        table.update_item(
            Key={'userId': user_id, 'postId': post['postId']},
            UpdateExpression='SET deletedByCreator = :true',
            ExpressionAttributeValues={':true': True}
        )
    # Posts still in DB, just marked!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Posts stay visible to others who already saw them
- ✅ Social feed not disrupted
- ✅ Creator can't see them anymore (illusion of delete)
- ✅ Can undo/restore if needed
- ✅ Keeps analytics data
- ✅ Better user experience for everyone

## 🔐 Privacy Implications

### **If Alice wants posts TRULY gone:**

Option 1: Make private instead of delete
```python
# Change isPrivate to true
update_feed_privacy(user_id, topic, is_private=True)
```
- Hides from public feed immediately
- Still visible to Alice in her dropdown

Option 2: Add "hard delete" option (future feature)
```python
# Actual deletion from DB
if confirm_hard_delete:
    delete_posts_permanently(user_id, topic)
```
- Confirm dialog: "This will remove posts from everyone's feed. Are you sure?"

## 📊 Database State Over Time

### **Week 1:**
```javascript
{userId: "alice123", topic: "AI", deletedByCreator: false}  // Active
{userId: "bob456", topic: "quantum", deletedByCreator: false}  // Active
```

### **Week 2: Alice "deletes" AI topic**
```javascript
{userId: "alice123", topic: "AI", deletedByCreator: true}  // Soft deleted
{userId: "bob456", topic: "quantum", deletedByCreator: false}  // Active
```

### **Week 3: Bob still sees Alice's AI posts**
```
Bob's Public Feed:
- Alice's AI posts (from Week 1) ✅
- Bob's quantum posts ✅
- New posts from others ✅
```

### **Week 4: Charlie joins**
```
Charlie's Public Feed:
- Bob's quantum posts ✅
- New posts ✅
- Alice's AI posts ❌ (filtered out from public feed for NEW viewers)
```

## 🎯 Business Logic Summary

| Action | Creator View | Other Users View | DB State |
|--------|--------------|------------------|----------|
| **Create Feed** | Visible in dropdown & public feed | Visible in public feed | `deletedByCreator: false` |
| **Delete Feed** | Removed from dropdown, not in their view | Still visible in public feed | `deletedByCreator: true` |
| **Make Private** | Visible only to creator | Hidden from public feed | `isPrivate: true` |

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### **1. Restore Deleted Feeds**
```python
def restore_feed(user_id, topic):
    # Un-delete: set deletedByCreator = false
    # Topic appears in creator's dropdown again
```

### **2. True Delete Option**
```python
def permanent_delete_feed(user_id, topic):
    # Show warning
    # If confirmed, actually remove from DB
    # Disappears from everyone's view
```

### **3. Archive Instead of Delete**
```python
def archive_feed(user_id, topic):
    # Set archived = true
    # Hidden from dropdown but can be accessed in "Archived" section
    # Still in public feed
```
