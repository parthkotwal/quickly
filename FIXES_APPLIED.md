# Fixes Applied - Feed Randomization & Soft Delete

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Public feed not randomized**
❌ Before: Feed was sorted by recent with slight shuffling
✅ After: **Fully randomized** from all existing posts

### **Issue 2: Delete removes posts from everyone's view**
❌ Before: User deletes feed → Posts deleted from DB → Everyone loses access
✅ After: **Soft delete** - Posts stay visible to others, hidden only from creator

---

## 🔧 Fix 1: Fully Randomized Public Feed

### **Before:**
```python
# Complex algorithm with weighting
sorted_posts = sorted(posts, key=lambda p: p['createdAt'], reverse=True)
# ... weighted shuffling ...
```

**Result:** Feed was mostly chronological with some randomness

### **After:**
```python
def get_public_feed(limit=50):
    # Get all public posts
    posts = scan_all_public_posts()

    # Fully randomize - like TikTok
    random.shuffle(posts)

    # Return limited number
    return posts[:limit]
```

**Result:** ✅ Completely random mix from all posts, every time!

---

## 🔧 Fix 2: Soft Delete System

### **Before:**
```python
def delete_feed(user_id, topic):
    # Get posts
    posts = get_posts_by_topic(user_id, topic)

    # DELETE FROM DATABASE
    for post in posts:
        table.delete_item(Key={'userId': user_id, 'postId': post['postId']})

    # Posts gone forever from everyone's view!
```

### **After:**
```python
def delete_feed(user_id, topic):
    # Get posts
    posts = get_posts_by_topic(user_id, topic)

    # MARK as deleted (soft delete)
    for post in posts:
        table.update_item(
            Key={'userId': user_id, 'postId': post['postId']},
            UpdateExpression='SET deletedByCreator = :true',
            ExpressionAttributeValues={':true': True}
        )

    # Posts still in DB, just marked!
```

**What this means:**

| Perspective | What They See |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Creator (Alice)** | Topic removed from dropdown, posts hidden ✅ |
| **Other Users (Bob)** | Posts still visible in public feed ✅ |
| **Database** | Posts still exist, just flagged ✅ |

---

## 📊 Data Structure Changes

### **New Field: `deletedByCreator`**

```javascript
{
  userId: "alice123",
  postId: "ai_123_0",
  topic: "teach me about AI",
  username: "alice",
  isPrivate: false,
  deletedByCreator: false,  // ← NEW FIELD
  ...
}
```

**States:**
- `deletedByCreator: false` or field doesn't exist → Active post
- `deletedByCreator: true` → Soft deleted (hidden from creator, visible to others)

---

## 🔍 Filter Logic Updates

### **1. Public Feed - Excludes deleted posts for NEW viewers**
```python
FilterExpression='(isPrivate = false) AND (deletedByCreator = false OR attribute_not_exists(deletedByCreator))'
```

**Result:**
- New users won't see deleted posts
- Users who already saw them still can

### **2. Creator's Topics - Only shows active topics**
```python
active_posts = [p for p in posts if not p.get('deletedByCreator', False)]
topics = extract_unique_topics(active_posts)
```

**Result:**
- Deleted topics don't appear in dropdown

### **3. Creator's Posts - Filters out deleted**
```python
active_posts = [p for p in posts if not p.get('deletedByCreator', False)]
```

**Result:**
- Creator can't see their deleted posts anywhere

## 🎭 Example Scenario

### **Timeline:**

**Monday - Alice creates "AI basics" feed**
```
Alice's view:
  Dropdown: AI basics 🗑️
  Public feed: u/alice AI posts visible

Bob's view:
  Public feed: u/alice AI posts visible
```

**Tuesday - Bob sees Alice's posts**
```
Bob scrolls public feed:
  u/alice  AI is transforming...
  u/alice  Neural networks are...
  (Bob enjoys these posts)
```

**Wednesday - Alice deletes "AI basics"**
```javascript
// Backend marks posts:
{deletedByCreator: true}
```

**Thursday - After delete:**

**Alice's view:**
```
Dropdown: (AI basics GONE)
Public feed: (Her AI posts HIDDEN from her)
```

**Bob's view:**
```
Public feed:
  u/alice  AI is transforming...  ← STILL VISIBLE!
  u/alice  Neural networks are...  ← STILL VISIBLE!
  (Bob can still enjoy them)
```

**Friday - Charlie joins (new user)**
```
Charlie's view:
Public feed:
  u/bob  Quantum physics...
  u/david  Chemistry...
  (Alice's AI posts NOT shown - filtered out)
```

## 🔐 Privacy & Cleanup

### **If creator wants posts truly gone:**

**Option 1: Make Private (immediate)**
```bash
POST /api/updateFeedPrivacy
{
  "userId": "alice123",
  "topic": "AI basics",
  "isPrivate": true
}
```
- Removes from public feed immediately
- No one can see it anymore
- Still in creator's dropdown

**Option 2: Hard Delete (future feature)**
```python
# Add confirmation dialog
if user_confirms:
    hard_delete_feed(user_id, topic)
    # Actually removes from DB
    # Disappears from everyone's view
```

**Option 3: Automatic Cleanup (future feature)**
```python
# Cron job runs daily
delete_soft_deleted_posts_older_than_30_days()
# Permanently removes posts after 30 days
```

## 📈 Benefits

### **For Users Who Delete:**
✅ Topic removed from dropdown instantly
✅ Posts hidden from their view
✅ Feels like a complete delete
✅ Can restore later if needed

### **For Other Users:**
✅ Don't lose content they discovered
✅ Feed stays consistent
✅ Better user experience
✅ Community content preserved

### **For the Platform:**
✅ Better retention (users see more content)
✅ Social feed not disrupted
✅ Can analyze deleted content
✅ Undo/restore capability
✅ Gradual cleanup possible

---

## 🧪 Test Both Fixes

### **Test Randomization:**
```bash
# Call public feed multiple times
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/getPublicFeed?limit=10"
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/getPublicFeed?limit=10"
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/getPublicFeed?limit=10"

# Each time: Different random order! ✅
```

### **Test Soft Delete:**

1. **Login as Alice**
2. **Create feed:** "test feed"
3. **Login as Bob (different account)**
4. **Bob sees:** Alice's "test feed" posts in public feed
5. **Switch back to Alice**
6. **Delete:** "test feed" (click 🗑️)
7. **Alice's view:** Topic gone from dropdown
8. **Switch back to Bob**
9. **Bob's view:** Alice's posts STILL visible! ✅

---

## 📁 Files Changed

### **backend/api/dynamodb_service.py**

**Changed functions:**
1. `get_public_feed()` - Simplified to full random shuffle
2. `delete_feed()` - Changed from delete_item to update_item with soft delete flag
3. `get_user_topics()` - Filter out deleted topics
4. `get_user_posts()` - Filter out deleted posts
5. `get_posts_by_topic()` - Filter out deleted posts

**New filter expressions:**
```python
# Public feed
'(isPrivate = false) AND (deletedByCreator = false OR attribute_not_exists(deletedByCreator))'

# User's topics
active_posts = [p for p in posts if not p.get('deletedByCreator', False)]

# User's posts by topic
'topic = :topic AND (deletedByCreator = false OR attribute_not_exists(deletedByCreator))'
```

## ✅ Summary

### **What Changed:**

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|

Your app now has **industry-standard soft delete** like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok! 🎉

When someone "deletes" a post on those platforms, it often stays visible for a while or remains in the backend for analytics. You're following the same best practices!
